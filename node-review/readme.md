# Node workshop

In this workshop, we'll build up a NodeJS app from the ground up and check our understanding as we go along.

Remember to preview the `README` first.


## Level 400

Welcome to Node Workshop Level 400.


Firstly,

Look inside `app.js`, and answer the following:

Q1) What output do you get in your terminal when you run the command `npm start` and make a request to `localhost:9090`


{YOUR_ANSWER_HERE}

Explain why you get this answer. How can you fix this issue?
Answer: It will give error message.

2) Fix the problem in Q1). Restart the server and call the `localhost:9090` endpoint again - what do you get in your terminal this time? Explain your answer.

{YOUR_ANSWER_HERE}
Answer: i need to write request and response to the funtion and change the 201 to 200,also add server.listen then install npm 

3) Double check you're not getting any errors in the terminal when you make a request to the localhost:9090 endpoint.
Additionally, test the server again using another client application like Postman or the browser.


## Requirements

We're going to make the requirements clearer now.

We need to set up a **single endpoint**.

For this endpoint, a client application should be able to make a GET request to the "/" endpoint
and the server should respond with

- a message saying "You've successfully reached the server" 
- and status code 200.

You'll need to keep testing this endpoint works by starting a locally hosted server on port 9090. Remember to check the response body and the status code.
